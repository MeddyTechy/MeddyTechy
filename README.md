- 👋 Hi, I’m @MeddyTechy on GitHub . My extensive education, experience and skills cover multiple disciplines.
- 👀 I’m interested in using my Project Management and software development experiences to positively affect lives and bottom lines.
- 🌱 I’m modernizing my team development knowledge, as well as improving my skills in Python and a plethora of concepts and development tools
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pushing your project or startup into the "Win" category.
- 📫 How to reach me: text or phone 817-932-3693 any time, any day.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've saved many lives at a level 1 trauma center (I can handle stress!), but never lost IT development skills :-)
