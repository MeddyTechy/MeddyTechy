- Hi, I’m @MeddyTechy on GitHub. A scientist at heart; Expertise in IT and medicine/healthcare, pharmacology, many industries.
- I’m interested in using my Data Modeling, Project Management and software development experiences to positively affect lives and bottom lines.
- I’m modernizing my team development knowledge, as well as improving my skills in Python and a plethora of concepts and development tools
- I’m looking to collaborate on pushing your project or startup into the "Win" category.
- How to reach me: text or phone 817-932-3693 any time, any day.
- Fun fact: I've saved many lives at a level 1 trauma center (I can handle stress!), but never lost IT development skills :-)
